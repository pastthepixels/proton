# What is proton.js, anyway?
Proton.JS or proton.js is split into two parts: Proton2D (that is soon to go) and Proton3D.  
Proton3D needs two parts to run: a scene and the Proton3DInterpreter, which takes proton.js inputs and turns them into inputs for any 3D engine. Keep in mind that is uses three.js' Vector3 object for 3D coordinates.  
If you're confused, check the wiki (which I should be updating, but that kind of stuff is my weakness).
