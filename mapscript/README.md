# MapScript
MapScript is an extended form of JavaScript with added keywords for minification/ease-of-use and for quick coding of... maps for games. Proton handles everything else, so it's intended for use throughout the Proton engine (currently only ProtonJS). Sample code would look like this:  
```
log( "Hello world!" );
```
Hopefully someday it'll evolve to its own scripting language.
